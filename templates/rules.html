                <h2>Scoring Overview</h2>
                <label for="scoring" id="scoring-label">Points are earned (or lost) according to the following: </label>
                <ul id="scoring" class="scoring">
                    <li>+8/6/4/2 points for 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th place respectively</li>
                    <li>+1 to the player who draws first blood (combat damage only)</li>
                    <li>+1 for casting your commander four or more times</li>
                    <li>+1 saving another player from elimination (max 1/opponent)</li>
                    <li>+1 killing anyone with commander damage (max 1 point)</li>
                    <li>-1 killing everyone in the same turn or going infinite</li>
                    <li>-1 attacking the player in sole possession of last place (in standings)</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Only applies if 4+ players at table</li>
                        <li>Does not apply if they attack you first</li>
                        <li>Only lasts until the start of turn 5</li>
                        <li>If the player in last does more than 10 damage to an opponent, limitations are removed for that opponent.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>-1 failing to cast/play your commander from the command zone</li>
                    <li>+1 to the player whose deck receives the most votes at the end of the game</li>
                    <li>+1 per challenge completed in games where challenges are included. </li>
                </ul>

                <ol id="rules-list" class="scoring">
                    <li>Points are accrued each match, with the sum of all matches being the season score</li>
                    <li>Any budget restrictions exclude commander cost and basic land cost, unless otherwise specified.</li>
                    <li>Flex Cash Cards: If a budget includes flex, you receive an additional 50$ in flex cash to "buy" 3 cards. Whatever flex cash
                        is leftover does not feed back into your deck costs. </li>
                    <ol class="alpha-list">
                        <li>These slots exist to give players access to more expensive cards and help alleviate budget
                        restraints and allow for the inclusion of a few 10-15$ cards in decks. </li>
                        <li>Further, these slots facilitate the inclusion of fetch lands and tutors which are
                            prohibitively expensive. Fetch lands and tutors chosen to fill flex slots cost 15$ towards
                            your flex card budget.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <li>Budget / Deck costs are determined by Deckstats.net.</li>
                    <li>A player cannot repeat a color combination between game weeks. </li>
                    <li>The player in sole possession of last place goes first. In the event of a tie, a roll between the tied parties will determine who goes first.</li>
